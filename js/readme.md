Since most of what applies to JavaScript applies to TypeScript as well, I will be using `.ts` files to demonstrate here<br>
For TypeScript-specific issues, I will create an inner directory

# Run
Running the files directly can be done with `ts-node`, `tsx`, or `deno`<br>
You can also change the extention to `.js` and simply use `node`
